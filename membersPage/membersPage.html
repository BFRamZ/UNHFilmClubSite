						<p class="description">About Me: I grew up in Berlin, New Hampshire and discovered my passion
						for filmmaking during my junior year of high school. In college, I went on to start the UNH
						Film Club with the goal in mind of building a group of creative minds who also love film. 
						I was lucky to find an amazing group of people who I can all consider my friends. Oh yeah,
						my favorite movie is <i>The Shining.</i> </p>

						<p class="description">About Me: I am a Junior English major with a minor in Film Studies.
						My main focus in film club is in screenwriting and directing; I hope to finish my first script
						before graduation. <i>Groundhog Day</i> (1993) is the greatest film ever made, and anyone that says
						otherwise is objectively wrong.</p>

						<p class="description">Hey, I’m Hanna! I’m not sure I could land on one favorite movie, but the
						movie I’ve seen the most is 100% Miyazaki’s <i>Spirited Away</i>. When it comes to filmmaking I’ve
						always been most interested in post production/editing. A fun fact about me is that a dream job
						of mine is getting to edit for reality TV (specifically <i>The Bachelor</i>). Even just being a camera
						operator would rock my world!</p>

						<p class="description">Hi I’m Hannah! I love everything about film, especially the cinematography
						and production process. I usually stick to editing, but I’d love to learn more about set design
						and directing.</p>
